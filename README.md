# Arrythmia-Classifier-using-GNN

## Prerequisite

- pytorch (1.9.0+)
- dgl (0.8.0 / cuda 11.3)
- dgl installation = [here](https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html)
- networkx
- numpy
- torchmetrics

## How to execute 
1. put data into training and testing folder (```npz file``` recommend)
2. run main.py

## Notice
- The dataset used MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, it is refined in the BCML lab. (Sharing is difficult.)
- Instead, [there](https://github.com/kaintels/GNN-classifier-test) is an example code.
